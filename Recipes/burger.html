<h1>Burger</h1>
<body>
  <p>
    A burger is a patty of ground beef grilled and placed between two halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, and other ingredients add flavor.Burgers are considered an American food but are popular around the world. In Japan, teriyaki burgers are popular. In India, vegetarian burgers are created using potato and mint instead of a meat patty.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Buns: Use whatever your heart desires! Usually, the bakery section will have soft buns such as brioche.</li>
    <li>Beef: I recommend 80/20 ground beef chuck.</li>
    <li>Cheese: Sharp cheddar, gouda, Havarti, Swiss, and pepper Jack are all great choices.</li>
    <li>Jalapeno: This is used to create the jalapeno cheddar buns! Seed the jalapenos if you don’t love heat.</li>
    <li>Patties: One egg and ¼ cup panko hold the burgers together, allowing us to add shallots, garlic and Worcestershire to pump up the flavor.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
    <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
    <liForm into four 3 quarter thick patties.></li>
    <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
   </ol>
